# Data Science for Kids

In this class we will be teaching kids the basics of JavaScript using p5js. 

We will be using the p5.js web editor which can be found [here](https://editor.p5js.org/).

## p5.js Introduction

p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is free and open-source because we believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone.

Using the metaphor of a sketch, p5.js has a full set of drawing functionality. However, youâ€™re not limited to your drawing canvas. You can think of your whole browser page as your sketch, including HTML5 objects for text, input, video, webcam, and sound.
